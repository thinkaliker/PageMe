# PageMe

## Background

For those in any industry who still have pagers and no access to phones (yes, you heard that right).

## Built with

- Firebase
- DigitalOcean
- CA DOT highway sign API

## Feature Roadmap

- (baseline feature port) a small database of pagers and scheduled weather every **weekday** at 16:30 PST
  - using Twilio or test page shim
- user accounts, logins, and configurable times for each account - using Firebase authentication API, connect Firebase user to existing phone number
- additional messages and hooks for external APIs
  - configurable HOV sign location API from dot.ca.gov
  - reminders

## Nice to haves

- stock alerts
- webhooks
